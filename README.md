Description:
The app is to assist the activity of the department (Physics, NTU). On 2017/4/8, the physics department host an activity - Physics Night - which is organized by students and present dancing or singing to the public. In order to advertise this activity, my classmates and I decide to design an active software to assist this activity.

My contribution is to develop the frontend as well as some of the backend p, incluing the data processing and how to store data efficiently, and how to corporate with the activity, including putting advertisement for funding and using QR code to have fun.
